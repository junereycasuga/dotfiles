# Feature Development

You are helping a developer implement a new feature. Follow a systematic aproach: understand the codebase deeploy, identify and ask about all underspecified details, design elegant architecgures, then implement.

## Core Principles

- **Ask clarifying questions**: Identify all ambiguities, edge cases, and underspecified behaviors. Ask specific, concrete questions rather than making assumptions. Wait for user answers before proceeding with the implementation. Ask questions early (after understanding the codebase, before designing architecture).
- **Understand before acting**: Read and comprehend existing code patterns first
- **Read files identified by agents**: When launching agents, ask them to return lists of the most important files to read. After agents complete, read those files to build detailed context before proceeding.
- **Simple and elegant**: Prioritize readable, maintainable, architecturally sound code.
- **Use TodoWrite**: Track all progress throughput

## Phase 1: Discovery

**Goal:** Understand what needs to be built

Initial request: $ARGUMENTS

The user may use a link to a Linear issue, Jira ticket, GitHub issue, or other relevant resource.

In case of a Linear issue, use the Linear MCP.
In case of a Jira ticket, use the Atlassian MCP.
In case of a GitHub issue, use the GitHub MCP.

**Actions:**

1. Create todolist wtih all phases
2. If feature unclear, ask user for:
   - What problem are they solving?
   - What should the feature do?
   - Any constraints or requirements?
3. Summarize understanding and confirm with user

## Phase 2: Codebase Exploration

**Goal:** Understand relevant existing code and patterns at both high and low levels

**Actions:**

1. Launch 2-3 code-explorer agents in parallel. Each agent should:
   - Trace through the code comprehensively and focus on getting a comprehensive understanding of abstractions, architecture and flow of control
   - Target a different aspect of the codebase (e.g., similar features, high level understanding, architectural understanding, user experience, etc)
   - Include a list of 5-10 key files to read

   **Example agent prompts:**
   - "Find features similar to [feature] and trace through their implementation"
   - "Map the architecture and abstractions for [feature area], tracing through the code comprehensively"
   - "Analyze the current implementation of [existing feature/area], tracing through the code comprehensively"
   - "Identify UI patterns, testing approaches, or extension points relevant to [feature]"
2. Once the agents return, please read all files identified by agents to build deep understanding
3. Present comprehensive summary of findings and patterns discovered

## Phase 3: Clarifying Questions

**Goal:** Fill in gaps and resolve all ambiguities before designing

**CRITICAL**: This is one of the most important phase. DO NOT SKIP.

**Actions:**

1. Review the codebase findings and original feature request
2. Identify underspecified aspects: edge cases, error handling, integration points, scope boundaries, design preferences, backward compatibility, performance needs
3. **Present all questions to the user in a clear, organize list**
4. **Wait for answers before proceeding to architecture design**

If the user says "whatever you think is best", provide your recommendatoin and get explicit confirmation.

## Phase 4: Architecture Design

**Goal:** Design multiple implementation approahces with different trade-offs

**Actions:**

1. Launch 2-3 code-architect agents in parallel with different focuses: minimal changes (smallest change, maximum reuse), clean architecture (maintainability, elegant abstractions), or pragmatic balance (speed + quality)
2. Review all aproaches and form your opinion on which fits best for this specific task (consider: small fix vs large feature, urgency, complexity, team context)
3. Present to user: brief summray of each approach, tade-offs comparison, **your recommendation with reasoning**, concrete implementation differences
4. **Ask user which approach they prefer**
5. When the architecture decision is made, write the document in a markdown file in `docs/feature/`

---

## Phase 5: Implementation

**Goal:** Build the feature

**DO NOT START WITHOUT USER APPROVAL**

**Actions:**

1. Wait for explicit user approval
2. Read all relevant files identified in previous phases
3. Implement following chosen architecture
4. Follow codebase conventions strictly
5. Write clean, well-documented code
6. Update todos as you progress

---

## Phase 6: Quality Review

**Goal:** Ensure code is simple, DRY, elegant, easy to read, and most importantly functionally correct and has security vulnerabilities mitigated

**Actions:**

1. Launch 2-3 code-reviewer agents in parallel with different focuses: simplicity/DRY/elegance, bugs/functional correctness, project conventions/abstractions, security
2. Consolidate findings and identify highest severity issues that you recommend fixing
3. **Present findings to user and ask what they want to do** (fix now, fix later, or proceed as-is)
4. Address issues based on user decision

---

## Phase 7: Summary

**Goal:** Document what was accomplished

**Actions:**

1. Mark all todos complete
2. Summarize:
   - What was built
   - Key decisions made
   - Files modified
   - Suggested next steps
